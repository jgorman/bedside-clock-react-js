> A bedside clock WebApp written in React.js

You can make the clock display quite dim in order to be readable at night without providing much illumination to the room. Studies have shown that ambient light at night can reduce sleep quality and can also lead to nearsightedness due to the eyes constantly attempting to focus while sleeping.

__[Live demo](https://johngorman.io/bedside-clock/reactjs)__

- Written in React.js with Redux state management.
- Also written in __[React Native](https://github.com/jgorman/bedside-clock-react-native)__!
- There is a lot of shared code between the two projects.
- The appstate.js Redux reducer files are identical between the two projects because the state flow is the same.
- A great pair of projects for anyone who wants to see exactly how React.js and React Native differ.
- Both projects store the app preferences state between sessions.
